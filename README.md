# TIACOS: Theory of information, architecture of computers and operating systems

4 projects for the theory of information, architecture of computers and operating systems subject of the bachelor's in bioinformatics in ESCI-UPF.

## Organization of the repository

**Project 1: Shelllab**
Practice the basic Unix commands and learn how to handle data from the shell. 
Skills: 
* Use man pages
* Basic system commands: cd, ls, mkdir, cp, rm, rmdir, mv

* "&" to execute a program in the background
* ">" redirecting the output
* "|" for inter process communication
* program a basic shell script
  
**Project 2: Proclab**
Practise the basic system calls to manage processes and to monitor kernel information associated with the active processes of the system.

Skills:
* **Basic user level**
  - Process managment system calls: fork, execlp, getpid, exit, wait, waitpid, signal, kill
  - Understand inheritance and parent/child relation
    
* **Admin user level**
  - Use process list of a user and check status using ps, top
  - Get information though the /proc pseudo-filesystem

**Project 3: Datalab**
Familiarize with bit-level representation of characters, integers and floating point numbers
Skills: 
* Manipulate character, integer and float modifications
* Program bit level manipulation in python
* Debug simple python scripts

**Project 4: IOlab**
Understand how input/output system calls work
Skills:
